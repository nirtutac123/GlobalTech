Chief Advisor

<!-- Our chief advisor from Scotland have had a long and successful career in all aspects of design. From clothing to retail outlets, production facilities. Then onto the intricacies of Festival management where she found to have all the abilities needed to create and resolve all threads of an event. From small urban venues to festivals with attendances of thousands. Thierry's many skills gain from forty years of being a self made business woman with also training in yacht design and a degree from the OU gained while she ran my own retail chain and bought up two daughters has lead to me taking on a consultancy role for people who need a person who has learnt to have an expert over view of all a project will encompasses. <p></p>
